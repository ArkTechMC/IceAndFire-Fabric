## FAQ

#### Other Minecraft Version?

This mod is planned to port to the later Minecraft version after bugs resolved and some rewrite complete.

Backport will not do, but anyone can port it.

#### I cannot find config file

As the config system is based on `Jupiter`, the config will only save needed data. You can change config by using client
side gui through mod menu. (Require server operator permission.)

#### How to change biome configs

Change biome tags by using datapacks.

## Critical bugs

**Please DO NOT report any issue to the original mod!**

Place `Dread Lands Portal` will crash (Can only be fixed with chunk editor / nbt explorer)

Myrmex cave may be cut. (I try my best to fix that)
